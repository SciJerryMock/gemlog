# Setting Up PQL
PQL (PASSCAL Quick Look) is a great tool for quickly perusing seismic/infrasound data. It is not a great tool for data analysis--use a scientific programming language for that instead. However, to my knowledge, PQL is the fastest way to scan data in order to look for events and obtain basic spectral information.

### PQL Installation (Ubuntu):
This procedure downloads an rpm file and processes it. It might be best to make a new folder in ~/Downloads and run the code from there. You can delete the download after running everything.
```
wget https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/ftp/software/pql/linux/x86_64/PQL-2010-246.x86_64.rpm
sudo apt install alien
sudo alien --to-deb *rpm
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite *deb
```

Then, open ~/.bashrc with the text editor of your choice, and add these lines to the end. This tells your system where to look to find the right PQL command.
```
PATH=$PATH:/opt/passcal/bin/
alias pql='pql -l' # uses setting that makes it resizeable on small screens
```
then run `source ~/.bashrc` to implement your changes.

### PQL Installation (Mac)
Download the .pkg file from the latest release here: https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/ftp/software/passoft/osx/

Find the downloaded file and double-click to install. If the "unidentified source" error comes up, right click on the installation package, and choose "open".... Another warning will pop up, but you can hit "open" again, and it will start the installation process.  

Open the hidden file `~/.bash_profile` using your favorite text editor, and add the following lines to the very end. This tells your system where to look to find the PQL command.
```
PATH=$PATH:/opt/passcal/bin/
alias pql='pql -l' # uses setting that makes it resizeable on small screens
```
Then, run this command in the terminal to implement your changes: `source ~/.bash_profile`

Finally, run the command `pql` in the terminal. If you get a display error, you might need to run it through XTerm instead (which may require installing XQuartz).


### Configuring PQL
PQL's default configuration is not very convenient. I recommend changing the settings as follows.

First, change the settings on the left side of the main screen as follows for each of the following tabs.
* "Trace" tab: set window scale to "window", set time axis to "absolute"
* "Magnify" tab: set window scale to "window"
* "Spectra" tab: set window scale to "window"

Start by clicking the "Controls" button near the bottom left, and make the following changes 
Controls>General: sort settings to 1 absolute start time, 2 station, 3 channel
Controls>Overlay: change color #3 to anything that's more visible against pink background
Controls>Spectra: set both to log scale
Click "Set Defaults"
